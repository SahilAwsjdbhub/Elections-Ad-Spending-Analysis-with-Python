# Elections-Ad-Spending-Analysis-with-Python
This project dives into the world of election ad spending, using Python to analyze real data and uncover how campaigns allocate their resources. We'll explore three datasets:

Election Results: Who won, how many votes they got, and other key election metrics.
Advertisers: Who's behind the ads? This data might tell us about the advertisers themselves.
Locations: Where are the ads being seen? This helps us understand geographical trends.
By analyzing these datasets together, we aim to reveal insights like:

Which candidates spend the most on advertising?
Are there spending patterns based on location?
Can we identify any relationships between ad spending and election outcomes?
This project is your chance to peek behind the curtain of election campaigns and see how ad spending strategies unfold.

The dataset I have collected contains three files:

1     The **Advertisers Dataset** provides insights into which pages (parties or organizations) spend money on election ads and the volume of ads they run.

2     The **Locations Dataset** shows how much money was spent on ads in different locations, indicating where the campaigns were focusing their efforts.

3     The **Results Dataset** provides actual voting data, showing how many people voted in each area and the percentage of voter turnout.
